# APPLES (Analysis of Plant Promoter-Linked Elements) #

### Introduction ###
This repository contains the source codes for the CyVerse/iPlant version of the APPLES application package
Two functionalities are provided in this version:

* Finding Orthologs as Reciprocal Best Hits (rbh-apples)
* Finding Non-Coding Conserved Regions (conservation-apples)

Details of APPLES will be added here later. In the meantime, please check out our papers:
