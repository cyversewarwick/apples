# APPLES (Analysis of Plant Promoter-Linked Elements) #

### Introduction ###
This repository contains the source code for the CyVerse/iPlant version of the APPLES (Analysis of Plant Promoter-Linked Elements) application package. The APPLES software package is a set of tools to analyse promoter sequences on a genome-wide scale.
Two functionalities are provided in this version:

* Finding Orthologs as Reciprocal Best Hits (rbh-apples)
* Finding Non-Coding Conserved Regions (conservation-apples)

Details of this version of APPLES will be added here later. In the meantime, you can find more about the original APPLES following [this link](http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/people/sascha_ott/tools_and_software/apples), and please check out our papers:
