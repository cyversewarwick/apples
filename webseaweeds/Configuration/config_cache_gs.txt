# cache.dat

# "cache_save" settings are REQUIRED

# The old APPLES docs said this:
# ONLY this db will be used to store your results
#
# Things are a little different now.
# The name cache_save is used for compatibility reasons, we don't
# actually support multiple caches anymore. In Cache.pm, one of the
# following will be used. It is therefore best to only specify one
# cache server. Also, should you decide to name the cache differently,
# don't name them starting with 'db_...', since this is used by
# Cache.pm to detect the case when the settings are not actually
# stored in a section.
#
# If all that is too complicated, uncomment the next line to
# disable shared caching. However, note that then
#  a) other users won't be able to re-use your computational
#     results
#  b) your computations may take longer, as you can't re-use
#     things pre-computed by others, or by yourself.

#disable_caching = 1

# you can also disable cache reads, this is to update cache
# entries incrementally in case you have changed what you need
# to store in an individual type entry, but do not want to
# overwrite the whole cache.
# to enable write only access, set cache_writeonly to anything
# but 0

# cache_writeonly = 1

# equivalently, you can have a readonly cache, which will not
# be updated with new values (for experimental computations)
# to enable read only access, set cache_readonly to anything
# but 0
